    WEEK 1
The first week session on 7habitd of highly effective people was a valuable opppurnity for me to learn key princples and practices for personal and professsional growth,The class typically covered each of the 7 habits in depth exploring concepts such as being proactive,beginning with an end in mind,putting first things first,thinking win-win,seeeking first to be understood,sygernizing and sharpening the saw.paticipants engaged in the variety of activities,discussions and exercises to apply these habits to their daily lives and working environment.Throughout the class,my fellow collegues in the zoom leatning sessions were encouraged to reflect on their current habits and behaviour patterns,and consider how they can make positive changes to become more effective and successful.By the end of the second week,students had a solid understanding of each habits and how to incoporate them in their routines.This class enchanced our leadership skills,boost self productivity and improved relationships with others.Overall the 7 habits of Highly Effective people class offfered a valuable framework for personal development and success.
